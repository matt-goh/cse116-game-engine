<h3>Coding Task 3 Overview</h3>
<hr>

 

<p>
    As usual, there are two components to this task. Both the <a target="_self" href="https://cse116.com/hw/task3.html#problem-set">Problem Set</a> and
    <a target="_self" href="https://cse116.com/hw/task3.html#game-features---learning-objective">Game Features - Learning Objective</a> portions of this document
    <em><b>MUST</b></em> be completed to achieve the Learning Objective points and pass the course. The
    <a target="_self" href="https://cse116.com/hw/task3.html#game-features---comprehensive-understanding">Game Features - Comprehensive Understanding</a> is not needed for the Learning
    Objective requirement, but completing/not completing it will directly impact your grade through CU points. The
    Problem Set is worth 20 LO points, while the Game Engine Task is worth 30 LO points and 50 CU points.
</p>
<p>
    You should complete the components below in the order they are listed; you will not be able to earn credit for the
    following component(s) until you complete the previous ones with all available points.
</p>
<p>
    Coding Task 3 assesses Polymorphism and Binary Trees. Both the Problem Set and Game Engine Task will focus on these
    topics.
</p>
<p>
    The video for this task can be found at
    <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3NGl37kjY4">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3NGl37kjY4</a>.
    This video gives an overview of the requirements for this task, namely the Game Features Learning Objective. As
    always, watching it is optional, but you will find it very useful.

<h3>Overview</h3>
<hr>

<p>
    Problem Set GitHub Repository link:
    <a href="https://github.com/CSE-116/ProblemSet-3">https://github.com/CSE-116/ProblemSet-3</a>
</p>

<ol>
    <li>Clone the starter code from the repository linked above into a new IntelliJ project</li>
    <li>
        Make sure the src folder is marked as the source root (Right-click the src folder, choose “mark
        directory as” and choose sources root)
    </li>
</ol>
<p>
    Once you have the project opened in IntelliJ, you'll see a src folder containing 2 Java packages named
    problem and tests.
</p>
<p>
    To submit your project, run <code>problem.Zipper</code>, which will create a zip file containing the
    problem set, and submit it to Autolab.
</p>

<hr>
<h3>Specification</h3>
<hr>

<p>
    For this problem set, you will write the follow 3 static methods that are all related to binary trees (the
    Game Features will include Polymorphism). The signatures for these methods exist in the handout repo and the
    methods are all stubbed out.
</p>

<ul>
    <li>
        In the <code>problem.ProblemSet3</code> class, complete the <code>maxBST</code> method, which takes a
        <code>BST</code> of <code>Integer</code>s as a parameter and returns an <code>int</code>. This method
        returns the maximum value of the BST according to its <code>Comparator</code>.
        <ul>
            <li>
                Note that this method does not necessarily return the largest value in the tree since maximum is
                defined by the BST's <code>Comparator</code>. Maximum in this context can be thought of as the
                value that would come last if the values were fully sorted using this <code>Comparator</code>.
            </li>
            <li>
                If the <code>BST</code> is empty (ie. the root is null) this method should return 0.
            </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
</ul>

<br>

<ul>
    <li>
        In the <code>problem.ProblemSet3</code> class, complete the <code>maxBinaryTree</code> method, which
        takes a <code>BinaryTreeNode</code> of <code>Integer</code>s and an <code>Integer</code>
        <code>Comparator</code> as parameters and returns an <code>int</code>. This method returns the maximum
        value of the binary tree, defined by the parameter node as the root of the tree, according to the
        provided comparator.
        <ul>
            <li>
                This method is similar to <code>maxBST</code>, except the tree no longer has the structure of a
                BST. You should use the compartor to perform any comparisons that are needed to find the maximum
                value according to that comparator.
            </li>
            <li>
                If the binary tree is empty (ie. the root is null) this method should return 0.
            </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
</ul>

<br>

<ul>
    <li>
        In the <code>problem.ProblemSet3</code> class, complete the <code>isBST</code> method that takes a
        <code>BinaryTreeNode</code> of <code>Integer</code>s and an <code>Integer</code> <code>Comparator</code>
        as parameters and returns a <code>boolean</code>. This method returns true if the binary tree, defined
        by the parameter node as the root of the tree, is a valid BST according to the provided comparator, and
        false otherwise.
        <ul>
            <li>
                You may assume that no values are repeated in the tree. Therefore, you can address ties in
                value any way you'd like, and the result will be the same.
            </li>
            <li>
                An empty tree is considered a valid BST.
            </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
</ul>

<br>

<hr>
<h3>Testing Requirements</h3>
<hr>

<p>
    Write JUnit tests for the following methods from the specification in the <code>tests.TestProblemSet3</code>
    class. These tests should be annotated with <code>@Test</code>.
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        <code>maxBST</code>
        <ul>
            <li>
                Write tests for the <code>maxBST</code> method. Test that the proper value is returned in a
                variety of cases.
            </li>
            <li>
                When testing this method, you will need to create BST objects. You can use any/all of the
                provided <code>Integer</code> <code>Comparators</code> to create these BSTs.
            </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
        <code>maxBinaryTree</code> and <code>isBST</code>
        <ul>
            <li>
                Test for these methods are provided for you. You do not need to write any additional tests for
                these methods.
            </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
</ul>


<br>

<hr>
<h3>Programming Requirements</h3>
<hr>

<p>
    Implement the methods from the specification. You may wish to complete the Testing Requirements before you
    begin implementation, and it's suggested that you run these tests as you implement the methods.
</p>

<br>

<hr>
<h3>Autolab Feedback</h3>
<hr>

<p>
    Feedback from Autolab will be given in several phases. If you
    don't complete a phase, then feedback for the following phase(s) will not be given. You must complete all
    phases to earn the required
    score of 20 LOs. For the problem set, the phases will be as follows:
</p>
<ol>
    <li>
        Running your tests on a correct solution
        <ul>
            <li>Your tests will be run against a solution that is known to be correct. If your tests do
                not pass this correct solution, there is an error somewhere in your tests that must be
                fixed before you can move on with the assignment. If your tests don't get past this
                check, you should re-read this document and make sure you implemented your tests and
                code according the specification. You should also make sure that if there are multiple
                correct outputs to the input in your tests cases that you accept any of the outputs as
                correct.
            </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
        Checking your tests for feature coverage
        <ul>
            <li>The next phase is to check if your tests check for a variety of features defined by
                different inputs. You should write at least one test case for each feature to pass this
                phase.
            </li>
            <li>Passing this phase does not necessarily mean that your testing is completely thorough.
                Satisfying Autolab is the bare minimum testing requirement. Not all possible inputs are
                checked and it is sometimes possible to pass this phase with weak testing. If you are
                struggling to earn credit for code that you believe is correct, you should write more
                than the required tests
            </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
        Running my tests on your solution
        <ul>
            <li>Once Autolab is happy with your tests, it will run my tests against your code to check
                it for correctness. If your testing is thorough, and your code passes your tests, then
                you should pass this phase. If you pass your tests, but fail one of mine, it is an
                indicator that you should write more tests to help expose your bug.
            </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
</ol>
<p>
    Once you have successfully completed all three phases, you will have completed this Problem Set and Autolab
    will
    confirm this with a score of 20 LOs.

<h3>Overview</h3>
<hr>

<p>
    You will continue to build functionality for the Game Engine in this component of the task. This will be done on top
    of the code written for the previous tasks; you should not reclone or remove said code for this task or any future
    Game Features components.
</p>
<p>
    As with the previous tasks, there are two parts to the Game Features component: the Learning Objective and
    Comprehensive Understanding. The Learning Objective portion must be completed with a score of 30 LOs before the
    Comprehensive Understanding unlocks. Both portions of the Game Features will be submitted to the same assignment on
    Autolab.
</p>
<p>
    The content of the Learning Objective is primarily used in the Game Engine by Pacman. To play Pacman, during and
    after completing this Learning Objective, navigate to the class <code>app.Configuration</code> and change the
    <code>GAME</code> constant to <code>"pacman"</code>.
</p>
<p>
    It may look like there are a lot of classes to create and a lot of code to write for this task, but don't let this
    intimiate you. While that is true, most of the individual pieces are not overly complex, and have a lot of
    similarity between them. The amount of unique code you must write, and problems you must solve, is roughly in line
    with earlier tasks.
</p>
<p class="notice-me">
    You will need to use various utility methods found in the <code>app.gameengine.utils.PacmanUtils</code> class for
    this task. However, one of these methods is missing from the handout. You can find it <a href="https://cse116.com/static_files/files/task3/PacmanUtils.java">here</a>, and should copy that method into your own class.
</p>
<p>For this Learning Objective portion, you will be writing code in the following classes which already exist:</p>
<ul>
    <li><code>Agent</code>, located in the <code>app.gameengine.model.gameobjects</code> package.</li>
    <li><code>Ghost</code>, located in the <code>app.games.pacman</code> package.</li>
    <li><code>Collectible</code>, located in the <code>app.gameengine.model.gameobjects</code> package.</li>
    <li>
        <code>MagicPickup</code>, <code>AxePickup</code>, and <code>PotionPickup</code>, located in the
        <code>app.games.commonobjects</code> package.
    </li>
    <li><code>Player</code>, located in the <code>app.gameengine.model.gameobjects</code> package.</li>
    <li><code>LevelParser</code>, located in the <code>app.gameengine</code> package.</li>
</ul>
<p>
    You should create the <code>TestTask3</code> class in your <code>app.tests</code> package. We have provided some
    tests for the various <code>Decision</code> and <code>Collectible</code> subclasses, as well as the
    <code>LevelParser</code> updates. They can be accessed at this link: <a href="https://cse116.com/static_files/files/task3/TestTask3.java">TestTask3.java</a>. You can open this link in a new tab to copy
    and paste the content into your project, or right click and select "save link as", then download the file to the
    correct location within the project.
</p>
<p>
    These tests are not overly thorough, but should validate some of the basic behavior of the features that they test,
    and let you know if you are on the right track.
</p>
<p>You will also have to create many additional classes, which will be specified in the following instructions.</p>
<p class="notice-me">
    Many of the features of this task, primarily dealing with the player's inventory and collectibles, heavily rely on
    each other, so one feature being implemented incorrectly may cause tests for other features to fail. Feedback in
    Autolab will usually note when this applies, but keep this in mind when looking over your feedback.
</p>

<br>
<hr>
<h3>Specification</h3>
<hr>

<p>
    You should read through all the following sections before you begin to implement the methods from the specification.
    Note that you will not receive feedback on the correctness of these methods until you've completed the testing
    component of this task (see the "Autolab Feedback" section for more details). However, you must at least create
    every class/method from this specification to receive feedback. You can "stub out" these methods by having them
    always return a fixed value, but they must exist so the grading code, and your tests, can compile and run.
</p>
<p>
    Some of the methods in this task will make use of the <code>BinaryTreeNode</code> class, found in the
    <code>app.gameengine.model.datastructures</code> package. You are required to use this class. It is identical to the
    <code>BinaryTreeNode</code> class used in the Problem Set. Note that this is <em>not</em> the <code>BST</code> class
    from the Problem Set.
</p>
<p>
    For the Learning Objective portion of the Game Features component for this task, you will implement the following
    functionality:
</p>
<ul>
    <p>
        Create the package <code>app.gameengine.model.ai</code>. Remember that a package is just a folder containing
        Java files. This package will contain a number of files that allow the ghosts in Pacman to have dynamic behavior
        depending on the state of the game at any given time.
    </p>
    <p>
        You will be using a decision tree to determine behavior, which will be represented as a binary tree of
        <code>Decision</code> objects. These decisions will determine either which action to take, depending on the game
        state, or perform an action, like movement.
    </p>
    <li>
        <code>Decision</code>: In the <code>app.gameengine.model.ai</code> package, create an
        <em><strong>abstract</strong></em> class named <code>Decision</code>. This represents a node in the decision
        tree that will either make a decision or take an action.
        <ul>
            <li>
                Create a constructor which takes in an <code>Agent</code> and a <code>String</code> as parameters, and
                store them as instance variables. These represent the <code>Agent</code> whose behavior is being is
                being controlled by this <code>Decision</code>, and the name of this node.
            </li>
            <li>
                Create methods named <code>getName</code> and <code>setName</code>, which are a getter and setter for
                the <code>String</code> name from the constructor. The purpose of the name is primarly for testing, and
                for differentiating nodes of the same type within a single tree.
            </li>
            <li>
                Create a method named <code>getAgent</code> which is a getter for the <code>Agent</code> from the
                constructor. You do not need to create a setter for this instance variable.
            </li>
            <li>
                Create an <em><strong>abstract</strong></em> method named <code>decide</code> which returns a boolean
                and takes in a <code>double</code> and a <code>Level</code>, representing the time since the last call
                and the current level, respectively.
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        As this method is abstract, it has no implementation. In child classes, this method will use
                        various states of the game, level, or agent to determine which action to take.
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
                Create an <em><strong>abstract</strong></em> method named <code>doAction</code> which returns
                <code>void</code> and takes in a <code>double</code> and a <code>Level</code>, representing the time
                since the last call and the current level, respectively.
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        As this method is abstract, it has no implementation. In child classes, this method will take
                        various actions to modify the state of the <code>Agent</code> to achieve the desired behavior.
                        This method will only be called if it is determined that this is the action that should be
                        taken, according to the rest of the decision tree.
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
        <code>DecisionTree</code>: In the <code>app.gameengine.model.ai</code> package, create a class named
        <code>DecisionTree</code>. This class will possess a binary tree of <code>Decision</code> objects, to determine
        what behavior an <code>Agent</code> should take, and accordingly take that action.
        <ul>
            <li>
                Create a constructor that takes in a <code>BinaryTreeNode</code> of <code>Decision</code>s, and store
                it as an instance variable.
            </li>
            <li>
                Create methods named <code>getTree</code> and <code>setTree</code>, which are a getter and setter for
                the <code>BinaryTreeNode</code> from the constructor.
            </li>
            <li>
                Create a method named <code>traverse</code> that returns a <code>Decision</code> and takes a
                <code>BinaryTreeNode</code> of <code>Decision</code>s, a <code>double</code>, and a <code>Level</code>
                as parameters. The <code>double</code> represents the amount of time passed since the last update, and
                the <code>Level</code> is the current level.
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        This method will traverse through the tree <strong>in the parameter</strong> (not the tree in
                        your instance variable), making decisions to go left or right by calling <code>decide</code> on
                        the <code>Decision</code> stored in each tree node. A value of true indicates that you should
                        "travel" to the right child node, and a value of false means travel to the left child node.
                    </li>
                    <li> When a leaf node is reached (a node where both left and right children are null), the
                        <code>Decision</code> value at that node should be returned. Keep in mind that the node in the
                        parameter itself might be a leaf node.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        When calling <code>decide</code>, you should pass in the <code>double</code> and
                        <code>Level</code> from the parameters as arguments.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        If a leaf node cannot be reached, this method should return null. This can happen if the tree is
                        empty, or if the tree has a node with only one child. In the case of a node with only one child,
                        the method should return null if that node's decision tells it to traverse in the opposite
                        direction of that child. For example, if a tree has only a left node, it is not a leaf, but if
                        the <code>decide</code> method returns true, you cannot traverse to the right, and should return
                        null. This is useful for handling poor tree structures, or having a state that performs no
                        action.
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
                Create a second, overloaded <code>traverse</code> method that returns <code>void</code> and takes a
                <code>double</code> and a <code>Level</code>, which represent the amount of time passed since the last
                update and the current level, respectively.
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        This method will call the first <code>traverse</code> method, passing the root of the tree (the
                        instance variable) as the first argument, and the parameters as the remaining arguments. Then
                        call <code>doAction</code> on the returned <code>Decision</code>, again using the parameters of
                        this method as the arguments.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        If the returned <code>Decision</code> is null, this method will do nothing.
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
</ul>

<br>

<ul>
    <p>
        Now you will create subclasses of the <code>Decision</code> class which implement behavior for the ghosts in
        Pacman. You should look at the <code>app.gameengine.utils.PacmanUtils</code> class, as you will need to use
        these methods within your <code>Decision</code> subclasses. You do not need to understand all of this code, and
        the specific methods to use will be mentioned each time. If you did not already, download the missing method
        <code>canAct</code> from <a href="https://cse116.com/static_files/files/task3/PacmanUtils.java">here</a> and add it to this class.
    </p>
    <p>
        Though you do not need to understand the implementation of these methods, you should understand what they do.
        They each include a Javadoc comment that explains the purpose of the method, the parameters, and the return
        value. In IntelliJ, you can hover over the name of a method to read the Javadocs.
    </p>
    <p>
        All of these classes will exist in the <code>app.gameengine.model.ai.pacman</code> package, which you should
        create.
    </p>
    <p>
        Remember that the <code>Decision</code> class has two main functionalities, the <code>decide</code> and
        <code>doAction</code> methods. For some subclasses, only one of these will be implemented, and such classes will
        only make sense in certain parts of the tree. For example, a subclass which stubs out the <code>decide</code>
        method and actually implements the <code>doAction</code> method would only make sense as a leaf node.
    </p>
    <p>
        Other decisions and actions are so closely related that it makes sense to include them within the same class.
        These classes could be placed anywhere within the tree, and in fact there will likely be duplicates, where one
        is used as the decision, and the other is used as the action.
    </p>
    <li>
        <code>IsActive</code>: In the <code>app.gameengine.model.ai.pacman</code> package, create a class named
        <code>IsActive</code> which extends <code>Decision</code>. This class will represent a decision on whether a
        ghost is in an active state, which is either chasing the player or retreating to one corner of the level
        (scattering).
        <ul>
            <li>
                Create a constructor which takes in a <code>Ghost</code> and a <code>String</code>, which are passed to
                the super constructor as the <code>Agent</code> and name. This is possible due to polymorphism, since
                <code>Ghost</code> is a subclass of <code>Agent</code>. You should also store the ghost as an instance
                variable.
            </li>
            <li>
                Override the <code>decide</code> method, which should return <code>true</code> if the <code>Ghost</code>
                from the constructor is in a chasing or scattering state, and <code>false</code> otherwise.
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        You can call the <code>getState</code> method on a <code>Ghost</code> to access its state. This
                        method returns a <code>String</code> representing which of several states the ghost is in.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        If the state is exactly <code>"Chase"</code> or <code>"Scatter"</code>, then the ghost is
                        considered to be in an active state, and this method should return <code>true</code>.
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
                Override the <code>doAction</code> method to do nothing.
            </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
        <code>Idle</code>: In the <code>app.gameengine.model.ai.pacman</code> package, create a class named
        <code>Idle</code> which extends <code>Decision</code>. This class will represent an action of bouncing up and
        down while the ghost is at its home location in the center of the level.
        <ul>
            <li>
                Create a constructor which takes in a <code>Ghost</code> and a <code>String</code>, which are passed to
                the super constructor as the <code>Agent</code> and name. You should also store the ghost as an instance
                variable.
            </li>
            <li>
                Override the <code>decide</code> method to always return <code>false</code>.
            </li>
            <li>
                Override the <code>doAction</code> method to do the following: If the magnitude of the ghost's velocity
                is greater than 0, this method should do nothing. Otherwise, you should negate both the x and y
                components of the ghost's
                orientation. Afterwards, you should call the <code>followPath</code> method on the <code>Ghost</code>
                object, passing in the <code>double</code> from the parameter.
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        You can calculate the magnitude of a vector as the square root of the sum of the squares of the
                        x and y components. It is equivalent to the euclidean distance between the vector and (0, 0).
                        You can (and should) use the <code>magnitude</code> method within the <code>Vector2D</code>
                        class.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        You should modify the ghost's orientation using the <code>setOrientation</code> method. Although
                        there exists a <code>negate</code> method in the <code>Vector2D</code> class, which negates both
                        the x and y components of a <code>Vector2D</code>, the <code>setOrientation</code> method is
                        needed to update the sprite of the ghost.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        This <code>followPath</code> method is the same as the one from the Task 2 CU, but is
                        implemented differently within the <code>Ghost</code> class. So, even if you did not complete
                        that CU, this will still function as intended.
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
        <code>Chase</code>: In the <code>app.gameengine.model.ai.pacman</code> package, create a class named
        <code>Chase</code> which extends <code>Decision</code>. This class will represent both a decision of whether a
        ghost is actively chasing the player, as well as the action of chasing.
        <ul>
            <li>
                Create a constructor which takes in a <code>Ghost</code>, a <code>PacmanGame</code>, and a
                <code>String</code>. You should pass the <code>Ghost</code> and <code>String</code> to the super
                constructor, and store the <code>Ghost</code> and <code>PacmanGame</code> as instance variables. You
                should create an additional <code>Vector2D</code> instance variable to store the last whole-numbered
                location of the ghost, which will be used by several of the utility methods provided. The initial value
                of this vector should be null.
            </li>
            <li>
                Override the <code>decide</code> method to return whether the ghost is in the chasing state.
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        You can call the <code>getState</code> method on a <code>Ghost</code> to access its state. This
                        method returns a <code>String</code> representing which of several states the ghost is in.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        If the state is exactly <code>"Chase"</code>, then the ghost is chasing the player, and this
                        method should return <code>true</code>.
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
                Override the <code>doAction</code> method. This method should use the methods in the
                <code>PacmanUtils</code> class to do the following sequence of actions. Only take these actions if the
                <code>PacmanUtils.canAct</code> method returns <code>true</code>, passing in the <code>Ghost</code> and
                <code>Vector2D</code> instance variables and the <code>double</code> parameter.
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        Find the tile that the ghost is targeting by calling the <code>PacmanUtils.getChaseTarget</code>
                        method. Note that you must pass in a <code>PacmanLevel</code>, so you cannot use the
                        <code>Level</code> parameter. Instead you should call <code>getCurrentLevel</code> on the
                        <code>PacmanGame</code> instance variable.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Get the valid directions of movement for the ghost by calling the
                        <code>PacmanUtils.getValidDirs</code> method, again with the game's current level and the ghost.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Find the actual direction of movement by calling the <code>PacmanUtils.getBestDirection</code>
                        method, passing in the valid directions, the location of the ghost, and the target
                        <code>Vector2D</code>.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        The <code>Vector2D</code> returned by <code>getBestDirection</code> may be null. If so, skip
                        this step. If it is not null, set the orientation of the ghost to the x and y components of that
                        <code>Vector2D</code>. Again, you should use the <code>setOrientation</code> method to do so.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Set your <code>Vector2D</code> instance variable equal to the rounded value of the ghost's
                        location. You may call <code>Math.round</code> on the individual components, or use the
                        <code>Vector2D.round</code> method.
                    </li>
                </ol>
                Finally, call the <code>followPath</code> method on the ghost object, passing in the <code>double</code>
                parameter. You should do this even if the <code>canAct</code> method returns <code>false</code>.
            </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
        <code>Scatter</code>: In the <code>app.gameengine.model.ai.pacman</code> package, create a class named
        <code>Scatter</code> which extends <code>Decision</code>. This class will represent the action of scattering,
        which is when the ghosts retreat to the corners of the level to give the player some breathing room.
        <ul>
            <li>
                Create a constructor which takes in a <code>Ghost</code>, a <code>PacmanGame</code>, and a
                <code>String</code>. You should pass the <code>Ghost</code> and <code>String</code> to the super
                constructor, and store the <code>Ghost</code> and <code>PacmanGame</code> as instance variables. You
                should create an additional <code>Vector2D</code> instance variable to store the last whole-numbered
                location of the ghost, which will be used by several of the utility methods provided. The initial value
                of this vector should be null.
            </li>
            <li>
                Override the <code>decide</code> method to always return <code>false</code>.
            </li>
            <li>
                Override the <code>doAction</code> method. The behavior of this method should be identical to that of
                the <code>Chase</code> class, except using the <code>PacmanUtils.getScatterTarget</code> method instead
                of the <code>PacmanUtils.getChaseTarget</code> method.
            </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
        <code>Dead</code>: In the <code>app.gameengine.model.ai.pacman</code> package, create a class named
        <code>Dead</code> which extends <code>Decision</code>. This class will represent the decision of whether a ghost
        has been eaten and should return to the spawn area, as well as the action of returning home.
        <ul>
            <li>
                Create a constructor which takes in a <code>Ghost</code>, a <code>PacmanGame</code>, and a
                <code>String</code>. You should pass the <code>Ghost</code> and <code>String</code> to the super
                constructor, and store the <code>Ghost</code> and <code>PacmanGame</code> as instance variables. You
                should create an additional <code>Vector2D</code> instance variable to store the last whole-numbered
                location of the ghost, which will be used by several of the utility methods provided. The initial value
                of this vector should be null.
            </li>
            <li>
                Override the <code>decide</code> method to return whether the ghost is in the dead state.
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        You can call the <code>getState</code> method on a <code>Ghost</code> to access its state. This
                        method returns a <code>String</code> representing which of several states the ghost is in.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        If the state is exactly <code>"Dead"</code>, then the ghost is dead, and this method should
                        return <code>true</code>.
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
                Override the <code>doAction</code> method. The behavior of this method should be identical to that of
                the <code>Chase</code> class, except using the <code>PacmanUtils.getHomeTarget</code> method instead
                of the <code>PacmanUtils.getChaseTarget</code> method. Note that this method only takes one argument,
                and does not need the ghost itself to be passed in.
            </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
        <code>Flee</code>: In the <code>app.gameengine.model.ai.pacman</code> package, create a class named
        <code>Flee</code> which extends <code>Decision</code>. This class will represent the decision of whether a ghost
        has is fleeing from the player, which happens when a power pellet has been eaten, as well as the action of
        running from the player, which involves moving in a random direction at each intersection.
        <ul>
            <li>
                Create a constructor which takes in a <code>Ghost</code>, a <code>PacmanGame</code>, and a
                <code>String</code>. You should pass the <code>Ghost</code> and <code>String</code> to the super
                constructor, and store the <code>Ghost</code> and <code>PacmanGame</code> as instance variables. You
                should create an additional <code>Vector2D</code> instance variable to store the last whole-numbered
                location of the ghost, which will be used by several of the utility methods provided. The initial value
                of this vector should be null.
            </li>
            <li>
                Override the <code>decide</code> method to return whether the ghost is in the frightened state.
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        You can call the <code>getState</code> method on a <code>Ghost</code> to access its state. This
                        method returns a <code>String</code> representing which of several states the ghost is in.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        If the state is exactly <code>"Frightened"</code>, then the ghost is fleeing, and this method
                        should return <code>true</code>.
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
                Override the <code>doAction</code> method. The behavior of this method is similar to but not exactly
                the same as that of the <code>Chase</code> class. Take the following actions if the
                <code>PacmanUtils.canAct</code> method returns <code>true</code>, passing in the <code>Ghost</code> and
                <code>Vector2D</code> instance variables and the <code>double</code> parameter.
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        Get the valid directions of movement for the ghost by calling the
                        <code>PacmanUtils.getValidDirs</code> method, again with the game's current level and the ghost.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Find the actual direction of movement by calling the <code>PacmanUtils.getRandomDirection</code>
                        method, passing in the valid directions.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        The <code>Vector2D</code> returned by <code>getRandomDirection</code> may be null. If so, skip
                        this step. If it is not null, set the orientation of the ghost to the x and y components of that
                        <code>Vector2D</code>. Again, you should use the <code>setOrientation</code> method to do so.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Set your <code>Vector2D</code> instance variable equal to the rounded value of the ghost's
                        location. You may call <code>Math.round</code> on the individual components, or use the
                        <code>Vector2D.round</code> method.
                    </li>
                </ol>
                Finally, call the <code>followPath</code> method on the ghost object, passing in the <code>double</code>
                parameter. You should do this even if the <code>canAct</code> method returns <code>false</code>.
            </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
</ul>

<br>

<ul>
    Now that you have created the decision tree and the many decisions it will use, you can implement it into Pacman.
    There are a couple of classes you need to modify and add to in order to achieve this.
    <li>
        <code>Agent</code>: Navigate the to <code>app.gameengine.model.gameobjects.Agent</code> class. Each
        <code>Agent</code> will possess a <code>DecisionTree</code> to determine and follow their behavior.
        <ul>
            <li>
                Create an instance variable of type <code>DecisionTree</code> within this class. It will initially be
                null.
            </li>
            <li>
                Create a getter and setter for this <code>DecisionTree</code>, named <code>getDecisionTree</code> and
                <code>setDecisionTree</code> respectively.
            </li>
            <li>
                Override the <code>update</code> method from the super class, which takes a <code>double</code> and a
                <code>Level</code> as parameters and returns <code>void</code>.
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        This method should first call the super update method, passing in the parameters as arguments.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        If the <code>DecisionTree</code> instance variable is not <code>null</code>, call traverse on
                        it. You should call the version of the method which does <em>not</em> take in a
                        <code>BinaryTreeNode</code>. If the <code>DecisionTree</code> is null, you do not need to do
                        anything.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        If you added the code from the Task 2 CU for showing <code>Agent</code> paths, you may keep that
                        here. You can place it before or after the new code.
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
        <code>Ghost</code>: Navigate to the <code>app.games.pacman.Ghost</code> class. You will modify the constructor
        to give ghosts a decision tree matching classic pacman behavior. You can add this anywhere in the constructor.
        <ul>
            <li>
                Recall that <code>Ghost</code> extends <code>Enemy</code>, which extends <code>Agent</code>, so
                <code>Ghost</code> has access to all of the methods in the <code>Agent</code> class.
            </li>
            <li>
                The structure of this decision tree is as follows. The root is an <code>IsActive</code> node.
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        If the ghost is active (to the right), there is a <code>Chase</code> node, acting as a decision;
                        if the ghost is in the chase state (to the right), there is another <code>Chase</code> node,
                        this time acting as an action; if the ghost is not in the chase state (to the left), there is a
                        <code>Scatter</code> node.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        If the ghost is not active (to the left), there is a <code>Dead</code> node, acting as a
                        decision; if the ghost is dead, there is another <code>Dead</code> node, this time acting as an
                        action; if the ghost is not dead, there is a <code>Flee</code> node, acting as a decision; from
                        here, if the ghost is fleeing, there is another <code>Flee</code> node, this time acting as an
                        action; if the ghost is not fleeing, there is an <code>Idle</code> node.
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
                Refer to this image for a visual of the correct <code>DecisionTree</code> structure: <br>
                <img src="./CSE116_ Task 3_files/decisionTree.png" ,="" class="img-fluid" alt="visual depiction of the pacman ghost decision tree" width="600">
            </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <br>
    You should now be able to play pacman and see the ghosts react dynamically to your actions. Every so often, on a
    timer, all of the ghosts will retreat (scatter) to the corners. If you eat a power pellet (the big ones), they will
    turn blue and start moving randomly. If you eat them they will return home, respawn, and begin chasing you again.
    <br>
    You may notice ghosts occasionally getting stuck on level geometry when moving around corners. That is an
    unfortunate amount of jankiness within the game engine at the moment, and does not signify any issues with your
    implementation.
</ul>

<br>

<ul>
    The last features you will add for the Learning Objective are for an inventory system for the player. This is not
    used in Pacman, so you should test this feature within the sample game. To play the sample game navigate to the
    class <code>app.Configuration</code> and change the <code>GAME</code> constant to <code>"sample game"</code>.
    <br>
    Some of the methods in the <code>Player</code> class that are referenced here do not exist yet. You may want to
    implement those methods first, or along with these classes and methods.
    <li>
        <code>Collectible</code>: Navigate to the <code>app.gameengine.model.gameobjects.Collectible</code> class, which
        is an abstract class representing an object that can be picked up and used by the player. Currently this class
        contains very little, but you will add extra functionality by adding methods and extending this class.
        <ul>
            <li>
                The constructor takes four parameters, two of which are passed to the super constructor. Store the
                remaining parameters in instance variables.
            </li>
            <li>
                Create a method named <code>getItemID</code> (note the capital "ID"), which is a getter for the itemID
                instance variable. It should take no parameters and return a <code>String</code>.
            </li>
            <li>
                Create an <em><strong>abstract</strong></em> method named <code>use</code>, which takes a
                <code>Level</code> as a parameter and returns <code>void</code>. This represents what occurs when the
                <code>Collectible</code> is used in game by the player.
            </li>
            <li>
                Override the <code>collideWithDynamicObject</code> method, which takes one
                <code>DynamicGameObject</code> parameter and returns <code>void</code>. If the dynamic object is the
                player, add this object to the player's inventory, and destroy this object.
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Remember that you can tell if any kind of <code>GameObject</code> is a <code>Player</code>
                        object by calling the <code>isPlayer</code> method on it.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        You should add the object to the player's inventory with the <code>addInventoryItem</code>
                        method. This method likely does not exist yet. Read ahead to see the specification for that
                        method.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Since this method exists in the <code>Player</code> class instead of the
                        <code>DynamicGameObject</code> class, you cannot call it on the parameter. Instead, call
                        <code>getPlayer</code> on the game that you stored as an instance variable.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        You should destroy the object by calling the <code>destroy</code> method on it. This will remove
                        it from the level, so that it is not rendered on the screen anymore and will not continue
                        colliding with the player.
                    </li>
                    <li>If the object is not the player, this method should do nothing.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
        <code>AxePickup</code>: navigate to the <code>app.games.commonobjects.AxePickup</code> class, which is a pickup
        that should allow the player to throw axe projectiles at enemies. Notice that this class extends
        <code>Collectible</code>, and that the name passed to the super constructor is "Axe". Add the following
        functionality.
        <ul>
            <li>
                Create an instance variable of type <code>Timer</code>. Use the <code>app.gameengine.utils.Timer</code>
                class, not one of the built-in Java timers. In the constructor, assign this instance variable to a new
                <code>Timer</code> with a cooldown of 0.25.
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        The <code>Timer</code> class allows objects to limit how frequently they can use used. In this
                        case, you will use the timer to limit how frequently axes can be thrown. You should look through
                        the methods in this class, but do not need to fully understand them.
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
                Create a getter for the <code>Timer</code> instance variable called <code>getTimer</code>, which takes
                no parameters and returns a <code>Timer</code>.
            </li>
            <li>
                Override and implement the <code>use</code> method from the <code>Collectible</code> class. If the
                cooldown period on the timer is up, this method should make the player fire an axe projectile.
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        To check if the timer cooldown has expired, use the <code>Timer.check</code> method on your
                        instance variable.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        To fire a projectile, use the <code>Level</code> parameter and call <code>getPlayer</code> to
                        get the <code>Player</code> object. On this <code>Player</code>, call
                        <code>fireProjectile</code>, which takes three arguments. The first argument is the projectile
                        to fire, which should be a new <code>PlayerAxeProjectile</code> object. The location of this
                        projectile does not matter, as it will be set within the <code>fireProjectile</code> method. The
                        second argument is the speed the projectile will be fired at, which should be set to exactly
                        <code>5</code>. The third argument should be the <code>Level</code> parameter.
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
                Override the <code>update</code> method, which has parameters of type <code>double</code> and
                <code>Level</code>, representing the time since the last update and the current level, respectively, and
                returns <code>void</code>.
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Call the super update method, passing the parameters as arguments.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Call <code>Timer.advance</code> on the <code>Timer</code> instance variable, passing in the
                        <code>double</code> parameter <code>dt</code>. This will ensure that the cooldown actually
                        decreases and the pickup can be used.
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
        <code>MagicPickup</code>: Navigate to the <code>app.games.commonobjects.MagicPickup</code> class, which is a
        pickup that should allow the player to fire magic projectiles at enemies. Notice that this class extends
        <code>Collectible</code>, and that the name passed to the super constructor is "Magic". You should create the
        same instance variables and methods as in the <code>AxePickup</code> class. The only difference should be that
        in the <code>use</code> method, when calling <code>fireProjectile</code>, you should pass in a
        <code>MagicProjectile</code> object, and a speed of <code>10</code>.
    </li>
    <li>
        <code>PotionPickup</code>: Navigate to the <code>app.games.commonobjects.PotionPickup</code> class, which is a
        pickup that should allow the player to regain some health when used. Notice that this class extends
        <code>Collectible</code>, and that the name passed to the super constructor is "Health Potion". Add the
        following functionality.
        <ul>
            <li>
                Create an instance variable of type <code>int</code>, and in the constructor, assign this instance
                variable to the constructor parameter "heal". This is the amount that the potion will heal the player
                by.
            </li>
            <li>
                Create a getter for for this instance variable called <code>getHealAmount</code>, which takes no
                parameters and returns an <code>int</code>.
            </li>
            <li>
                Override and implement the <code>use</code> method from the <code>Collectible</code> class. Increase the
                health of the player by the heal instance variable, and remove the potion from the player's inventory.
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        To get the player, you can call the <code>getPlayer</code> method on the <code>Level</code>
                        parameter.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        To access and modify the health of the player, you can use the <code>getHealth</code> and
                        <code>setHealth</code> methods respectively.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        To remove the item from the player's inventory, you should call the
                        <code>removeActiveItem</code> method. This method likely does not exist yet. Read ahead to see
                        the specification for that method.
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
                You do not need to override the update method, as this class does not possess a timer to increment.
            </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
</ul>

<br>

<ul>
    Now you will add methods for using and manipulating the player's inventory. In the
    <code>app.gameengine.model.gameobjects</code> package, make the following additions to the
    <code>Player</code> class to implement a functioning inventory system. Some of these methods will already exist, and
    you should just modify them. Others you will have to create.
    <li>
        <code>addInventoryItem</code>: Create a method named <code>addInventoryItem</code> that takes in a
        <code>Collectible</code> and returns <code>void</code>. This method should add the object from the parameter to
        the <code>Player</code>'s inventory.
        <ul>
            <li>
                Adding an item should never change the currently active item, except for when you pick up your first
                item
            </li>
            <li>
                This new object will be considered the "last" item in the list.
            </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
        <code>removeActiveItem</code>: Add a method named <code>removeActiveItem</code> which takes no parameters and
        returns <code>void</code>. This method should remove whatever the currently active item is from the
        <code>Player</code>'s inventory.
        <ul>
            <li>
                Once the currently active item is removed, the currently active item should become whatever was next in
                the inventory. For example, if you collected an Axe, then Magic, then a Health Potion, the currently
                active item would be the Axe. If this method is called, the remaining items are the Magic and the Health
                Potion, and the active item would be the Magic.
            </li>
            <li>
                If the item removed is the last item in the inventory (ie. the one most recently added), the active item
                would become the first item in the inventory (ie. the one least recently added). Be sure to account for
                this looping behavior in your code.
            </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
        <code>getActiveItem</code>: Add a method named <code>getActiveItem</code> that takes no parameters and returns a
        <code>Collectible</code>. This method should return whichever <code>Collectible</code> in the inventory is
        active.
        <ul>
            <li>If the inventory is empty, this method should return null.</li>
            <li>
                If an item is collected and the inventory was previously empty, that item should be the active item.
            </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
        <code>getActiveItemID</code>: Add a method called <code>getActiveItemID</code> (note the capital "ID") that
        takes in no parameters and returns a <code>String</code>.
        <ul>
            <li>
                This method should return the ID of the active <code>Collectible</code> from the inventory, by calling
                the <code>Collectible.getItemID</code> method on it.
            </li>
            <li>
                If the inventory is empty, this method should return the exact <code>String</code> "No item equipped".
            </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
        <code>cycleInventory</code>: Add a method called <code>cycleInventory</code> that takes no parameters and
        returns <code>void</code>. This method will cycle through the inventory, changing the item currently marked as
        active.
        <ul>
            <li>
                This should be done in the order the objects are collected. For example, if a player collected an Axe,
                then Magic, then a Potion, the first call to cycleInventory will change the active item from the Axe
                to Magic. The second call to cycleInventory will change the active item from Magic to the Potion.
            </li>
            <li>
                Once cycleInventory is called while the most recently collected item is active, the active item should
                be set back to the front of the inventory, to the least recently collected item. Thus in our previous
                example, the third call to cycleInventory will change the active item from the Potion to the Axe.
            </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
        <code>clearInventory</code>: Add a method called <code>clearInventory</code> that takes no parameters and
        returns <code>void</code>. This method will reset the inventory to its initial state, which should be empty.
    </li>
    <li>
        <code>update</code>: The update method already exists in this class. Add code which iterates over every item in
        the inventory and calls the <code>update</code> method on it, passing in both parameters.
        <ul>
            <li>
                The order in which these objects are updated does not matter, as long as each object is updated once.
            </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
        Note that since these methods are the only way the inventory can be accessed and none of them rely on a
        specific data structure, however you choose to represent the inventory internally does not matter so long as
        your implementation follows the expected behavior. The only requirements are that you are able to keep track of
        every item that is added and the object that is currently active.
    </li>
    <li>
        The inventory should initially be empty.
    </li>
</ul>
<ul>
    You also need to implement the ability to use objects, which will occur in the <code>app.gameengine.Level</code>
    class.
    <li>
        <code>actionButtonPressed</code>: In the <code>Level</code> class, implement the
        <code>actionButtonPressed</code> method. The signature for this method already exists, you should simply add
        functionality to it.
        <ul>
            <li>
                This method should call the <code>getActiveItem</code> method on the level's player to access the
                currently equipped <code>Collectible</code>. If there is an item equipped (ie. it is not null), this
                method should call the <code>use</code> method on that item, passing in <code>this</code> as the
                argument.
            </li>
            <li>
                You can access the <code>Player</code> for a level by calling the <code>getPlayer</code> method.
            </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    You can cycle your character's inventory in-game with the tab key. Pressing the space bar will call the
    <code>Level.actionButtonPressed</code> method, allowing you to use the active item to fire projectiles or use
    potions.
</ul>

<br>

<ul>
    The final features you will add are modifications to the <code>LevelParser</code> class so that the kinds of
    collectibles can be parsed. The sample game already contains an <code>AxePickup</code> and a
    <code>MagicPickup</code> in a couple of the levels. If you want to use the <code>PotionPickup</code> in game, you
    can add it to one of the levels. An example of this would be adding this line to one of the level csv files:
    "StaticGameObject,PotionPickup,13,13,50".
    <br>
    You can also create levels with the <a href="https://jbcarras.github.io/">level editor</a> which contain these
    objects.
    <li>
        <code>readStaticObject</code>: Modify this method so that it can recognize and return the following objects.
        <ul>
            <li>
                Add a case for <code>AxePickup</code> objects. If the string being checked is "AxePickup", a new
                <code>AxePickup</code> object should be returned. The <code>AxePickup</code> constructor
                takes two <code>double</code>s and a <code>Game</code>. The <code>double</code>s should be the variables
                <code>x</code> and <code>y</code>, and the <code>Game</code> should be the parameter <code>game</code>,
                all of which already exist in this method.
            </li>
            <li>
                Add a case for <code>MagicPickup</code> objects. If the string being checked is "MagicPickup", a new
                <code>MagicPickup</code> object should be returned. The <code>MagicPickup</code> constructor
                takes two <code>double</code>s and a <code>Game</code>. The <code>double</code>s should be the variables
                <code>x</code> and <code>y</code>, and the <code>Game</code> should be the parameter <code>game</code>,
                all of which already exist in this method.
            </li>
            <li>
                Add a case for <code>PotionPickup</code> objects. If the string being checked is "PotionPickup", a new
                <code>PotionPickup</code> object should be returned. The <code>PotionPickup</code> constructor
                takes two <code>double</code>s, an <code>int</code>, and a <code>Game</code>. The <code>double</code>s
                should be the variables <code>x</code> and <code>y</code>, and the <code>Game</code> should be the
                parameter <code>game</code>, all of which already exist in this method. The <code>int</code> should be
                the amount to heal, which is the fifth value in the line. Refer to the example above, where the amount
                to heal would be 50.
            </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
</ul>

<h3>Testing Utility</h3>
<hr>

<p>
    In the <code>app.tests</code> package, create a class called <code>TestDecision</code>, which extends the
    <code>Decision</code> class. This class will be used to help you test by simplifying the behavior of the
    <code>decide</code> and <code>doAction</code> methods. Specifically, we want the behavior of these methods to not
    depend on the actual state of the game, so that you can test the <code>DecisionTree</code> methods without setting
    complex properties of the game, player, and ghosts.
</p>
<p>
    The constuctor should take an <code>Agent</code>, a <code>String</code>, and a <code>boolean</code>. The first two
    parameters can be passed to the super constuctor, and the last should be stored as an instance variable. This
    boolean will be the value returned by <code>decide</code>, so it will decide which direction the traversal
    progresses.
</p>
<p>
    You should create another <code>boolean</code> instance variable representing whether the <code>TestDecision</code>
    has been used. It should initially be false.
</p>
<p>
    Create a method called <code>isUsed</code>, which takes no parameters and returns a boolean. It should return the
    instance variable described above.
</p>
<p>Override the <code>decide</code> method to return the instance variable for the traversal direction.</p>
<p>Override the <code>doAction</code> method to set the instance variable for whether it has been used to true.</p>

<br>
<hr>
<h3>Testing Requirements</h3>
<hr>

<p>
    Write JUnit tests for the following methods from the specification in the <code>TestTask3</code> class. These tests
    should be annotated with <code>@Test</code>.
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        <code>DecisionTree</code>:
        <ul>
            <li>
                To test these methods, you will have to create <code>Decision</code> objects to populate the
                <code>DecisionTree</code>. You are highly encouraged to use your <code>TestDecision</code> class.
            </li>
            <li>
                You must test BOTH of the <code>traverse</code> methods in this class.
            </li>
            <li>
                Test that the overload which takes a <code>BinaryTreeNode</code> returns the proper
                <code>Decision</code>, or null, with a variety of trees.
            </li>
            <li>
                Test that the other method calls <code>doAction</code> on the correct <code>Decision</code> node, and
                only on that node.
            </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
        <code>Player</code>:
        <ul>
            <li>
                <code>addInventoryItem</code> and <code>cycleInventory</code>:
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Write tests to ensure that adding items to the inventory has the proper behavior when cycling
                        through the inventory, i.e. calling <code>cycleInventory</code> will go through every added
                        <code>Collectible</code> and wrap around to the beginning.
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
                <code>removeActiveItem</code>:
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Write tests to ensure that calling <code>removeActiveItem</code> properly removes the active
                        item from the inventory and sets the new active item.
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
                When testing these methods, you only need to check that the item IDs match the expected.
            </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
        You DO NOT need to write tests for any of the remaining classes or methods. Tests have been provided for some of
        these as described in the overview section above.
    </li>
</ul>

<br>
<hr>
<h3>Programming Requirements</h3>
<hr>

<p>
    Implement the methods from the specification. You may wish to complete the Testing Requirements before you begin
    implementation, and it's suggested that you run these tests as you implement the methods.
</p>

<br>
<hr>
<h3>Autolab Feedback</h3>
<hr>

<p>
    Feedback for the Learning Objective component of the Game Features will be given in several phases. If you don't
    complete a phase, then feedback for the following phase(s) will not be given. You must complete all the following
    phases to earn the required score of 30 LOs to complete this task. The phases for the Learning Objective are as
    follows:
</p>
<ol>
    <li>
        Testing your testing utility method
        <ul>
            <li>
                Your testing utility method will be checked with a variety of test cases to ensure that it makes all the
                required checks. This phase will ensure that your utility method is accurate before you start using it
                in your tests.
            </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
        Running your tests on a correct solution
        <ul>
            <li>
                Your tests will be run against a solution that is known to be correct. If your tests do not pass this
                correct solution, there is an error somewhere in your tests that must be fixed before you can move on
                with the assignment. If your tests don't get past this check, you should re-read this document and make
                sure you implemented your tests and code according the specification. You should also make sure that if
                there are multiple correct outputs to the input in your tests cases that you accept any of the outputs
                as correct.
            </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
        Checking your tests for feature coverage
        <ul>
            <li>
                The next phase is to check if your tests check for a variety of features defined by different inputs.
                You should write at least one test case for each feature to pass this phase.
            </li>
            <li>
                Passing this phase does not necessarily mean that your testing is completely thorough. Satisfying
                Autolab is the bare minimum testing requirement. Not all possible inputs are checked and it is sometimes
                possible to pass this phase with weak testing. If you are struggling to earn credit for code that you
                believe is correct, you should write more than the required tests.
            </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
        Running my tests on your solution
        <ul>
            <li>
                Once Autolab is happy with your tests, it will run my tests against your code to check it for
                correctness. If your testing is thorough, and your code passes your tests, then you should pass this
                phase. If you pass your tests, but fail one of mine, it is an indicator that you should write more tests
                to help expose your bug.
            </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
</ol>
<p>
    Once you have successfully passed all four phases, you will have completed the Learning Objective component of the
    Game Features, and Autolab will confirm this with a score of 30 LOs.

<h3>Overview</h3>
<hr>

<p>
    For the Comprehensive Understanding portion of this task, you will implement functionality in the
    <code>app.gameengine.statistics.Scoreboard</code> class, and several classes that you will create in the
    <code>app.gameengine.model.datastructures</code> package, in order to create a functional scoreboard for several of
    the games. At the moment, the only games with scoreboards are Minesweeper and Pacman. Each of these games adds a
    score to the scoreboard whenever you win a game.
</p>
<p>
    Each of the classes and methods you implement will have an associated CU count that you will earn upon passing our
    tests for that method. Partially implemented methods may result in some partial credit being earned, depending on
    the method.
</p>
<hr>
<h3>Programming Requirements</h3>
<hr>
<ul>
    <li>
        Comparators (5 CUs each, 15 total)
        <ul>
            <li>
                For these classes and methods, you will need to use the <code>app.gameengine.statistics.GameState</code>
                class. It is a small, simple class, so you should look at and understand this class.
            </li>
            <li>
                Navigate to the <code>app.gameengine.model.datastructures.Comparator</code> class. Currently, this is a
                concrete class with a stubbed out method called <code>compare</code>. Modify this class such that it is
                an interface instead of a class, and make this method abstract. Do not modify the rest of the method
                signature. This is not worth any CUs on its own, but is required for the rest of the comparator classes.
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        This will result in a compilation error in the <code>Scoreboard</code> class, which tries to
                        instantiate a <code>Comparator</code>. You can fix this by changing this to be any of the
                        classes which implement the <code>Comparator</code> below, or by removing this constructor
                        entirely. If you remove the constructor, you should call the other constructor from within the
                        <code>Game</code> class when creating the scoreboard instance variable. Any of these solutions
                        are fine, and we won't test this constructor, or the default comparator.
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
                <code>LevelNameComparator</code>: In the <code>app.gameengine.model.datastructures</code> package,
                create a class named <code>LevelNameComparator</code>. This should implement the
                <code>Comparator&lt;GameStat&gt;</code>.
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Override the <code>compare</code> method to compare two <code>GameStat</code> objects based on
                        their entry names. If the first name is lexicographically less than the second, this method
                        should return <code>true</code>, and it should return <code>false</code> in all other cases.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        You may find the <code>String.compareTo</code> method useful for performing this comparison.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        If the two names are equivalent, this method should return <code>false</code>, since a
                        <code>String</code> cannot be lexicographically less than itself.
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
                <code>PlaytimeComparator</code>: In the <code>app.gameengine.model.datastructures</code> package, create
                a class named <code>PlaytimeComparator</code>. This should implement the
                <code>Comparator&lt;GameStat&gt;</code>.
                <ul>
                    <li>

                        Override the <code>compare</code> method to compare two <code>GameStat</code> objects based on
                        their playtimes. If the first playtime is less than the second, this method should return
                        <code>true</code>, and it should return <code>false</code> in all other cases.
                    </li>
                    <li>This method should break ties by returning <code>false</code>.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
                <code>ScoreComparator</code>: In the <code>app.gameengine.model.datastructures</code> package, create a
                class named <code>ScoreComparator</code>. This should implement the
                <code>Comparator&lt;GameStat&gt;</code>.
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Override the <code>compare</code> method to compare two <code>GameStat</code> objects based on
                        their scores. If the first score is greater than the second, this method should return
                        <code>true</code>, and it should return <code>false</code> in all other cases.
                    </li>
                    <li>This method should break ties by returning <code>false</code>.</li>
                </ul>

        Scoreboard basics (5 CUs)
        <ul>
            <li>
                Navigate to the <code>app.gameengine.statistics.Scoreboard</code> class. Modify the constructor which
                takes two parameters so that the <code>Comparator</code> is stored as an instance variable.
            </li>
            <li>
                Create getters and setters for this comparator instance variable, named <code>getComparator</code> and
                <code>setComparator</code> respectively.
            </li>
            <li>
                Create an instance variable that is a <code>BinaryTreeNode</code> of <code>GameStat</code>s. This will
                act as a BST to store and sort the scores in a game according to the comparator.
            </li>
            <li>
                Create getters and setters for this instance variable named <code>getScoreTree</code> and
                <code>setScoreTree</code>, respectively.
            </li>
            <li>
                Complete the existing <code>addScore</code> method to add the input <code>GameStat</code> to the correct
                location in the tree, according to the comparator.
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Although the comparator could potentially change during the game, invalidating the sorting of
                        your tree, your code does not need to handle this case. You can assume that the
                        <code>setComparator</code> method will only ever be called before any scores are added.
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
</ul>
<ul>
    <li>
        Scoreboard <code>loadStats</code> method (5 CUs)
        <ul>
            <li>
                Complete the existing <code>loadStats</code> method to load the existing stats from previous games. This
                will ensure that high scores carry carry over when the game is closed and restarted. Note that this
                method requires a functioning implementation of the <code>addScore</code> method.
            </li>
            <li>
                The existing <code>statsPath</code> instance variable will be the location of the csv file which stores
                the stats. Each csv file will have one score per line, as "entryName,playTime,score". You should read
                each line in this file, parse it to create a <code>GameStat</code> object corresponding to that line,
                and add it to the tree using the <code>addScore</code> method.
            </li>
            <li>
                This process must only occur once for a given scoreboard. If this method is called more than once, every
                following call should do nothing.
            </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
</ul>
<ul>
    <li>
        Scoreboard <code>getScoreList</code> methods (25 CUs)
        <ul>
            <li>
                Complete the existing <code>getScoreList</code> method to return a <code>LinkedListNode</code> that is
                the head of a sorted list containing every element in the tree, according to the comparator.
            </li>
            <li>
                If the tree is null, meaning that no scores have been added, this method should return null.
            </li>
            <li>
                Create an overloaded method for <code>getScoreList</code> which takes a <code>BinaryTreeNode</code> of
                <code>GameStat</code> as a parameter and returns a <code>LinkedListNode</code> that is the head of a
                sorted list containing every element in the input tree.
            </li>
            <li>
                This method may assume that the input tree is a valid BST according to the class' comparator.
            </li>
            <li>
                If the input tree is null, this method should return null.
            </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
</ul>
<ul>
    <li>
        Now, when you complete a game of Minesweeper or Pacman, you should see an entry added to the scoreboard, which
        is accessible from the pause menu, reached by pressing the escape key. The easiest way to test this is by
        playing Minesweeper, and pressing escape before selecting a difficulty. This will default to the trivial
        difficulty, which only has 3 mines and should be quite easy (as long as you understand the rules of
        Minesweeper).
    </li>
    <li>
        If you wish to add a scoreboard to other games, like snake, you can do so, but this is optional. There are a few
        adjustments you need to make in order for this to work. First, in the <code>SnakeGame</code> constructor, you
        should set the comparator to the desired metric. You must then choose a place to add a score to the scoreboard.
        It would likely make the most sense to add this in both the <code>advanceLevel</code> and
        <code>resetCurrentLevel</code> methods, so that both winning and losing the game save the score. In either case,
        you can use the <code>getScoreboard</code> method to get the scoreboard, and then add a new
        <code>GameStat</code> entry. You can use the <code>getScore</code> and <code>getPlaytime</code> methods of the
        <code>Level</code> class to create the <code>GameState</code>.

<h3>Autolab Feedback</h3>
<hr>
<p>
    The Comprehensive Understanding tests will unlock once you have earned 30 LOs on the assignment. These will be run
    in a single phase for correctness. For each test you successfully pass, you will earn a varying amount of CUs with a
    total maximum score of 50 CUs.
</p>
<p>
    There is no required testing component for the Comprehensive Understanding; however, you are expected to test your
    code nonetheless as the Autolab feedback is unlikely to be sufficient for debugging.
