/**
 * Keyboard controls suitable for a Platformer.

 * This class defines many constants that can be tuned for use in various
 * platformers. The defaults were chosen to feel somewhat similar to the game
 * Animal Well, because that game is awesome.
 * <p>
 * This class offers a lot of flexibility, and a high degree of variability can
 * be achieved simply through extending this class and modifying the default
 * values. These values controls qualities such as the movement speed, movement
 * acceleration, and friction, all of which can be separately controlled for the
 * ground and in the air.
 * <p>
 * Note that this class assumes it is being used with a platformer, and that the
 * player is a {@code PlatformerPlayer} or a subclass.
